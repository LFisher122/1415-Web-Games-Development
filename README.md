The Client holds all the resources needed for a client to play.

The Server holds all the resources needed for the server to run.
You'll need to install node.js on the server.
After installing node.js you will have to run the command "npm install" to install the dependencies.
To run the app use the command "node app.js" to start the server.
Please note: These instructions imply you have node.js installed as an environment variable. You can either make node an environment variable or incude the path to node.exe in the command. eg: "C:\Program Files\node.js\bin\node app.js" to run the app and "C:\Program Files\node.js\bin\npm install" to install dependencies.
